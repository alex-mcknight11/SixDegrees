**Name of Student:** Alex McKnight

**Name of Project:** Six Degrees

**Project's Purpose or Goal: (What will it do for users?)**
The project exists as a game to test a user's film knowledge: based on the parlor game "Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon" a user must attempt to link 2 randomly selected actors together through the films they've been in. (I.E. If a user has to find the link between Vince Vaughn and Jackie Chan, one path could be
- Vince Vaughn -> Wedding Crashers -> Owen Wilson -> Shanghai Noon -> Jackie Chan.
This would give Vince Vaughn 2 degrees of separation from Jackie Chan.)

**List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:**
- Users must receive 2 randomly selected actors from a pool
- Users must be able to access the films both actors appeared in
- Users must be able to select an actor from the selected film

**What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.**
- Javascript
- React
- The Movie Database API

**If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.**
- UI updates and QOL improvements, such as greater visibility and ease of access
- A "classic mode" where the ending actor is always Kevin Bacon
- A "challenge mode" with 3 actors, requiring a path through the 2nd actor to get to the ending actor

**What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?**
- potentially Axios
- potentially (but unlikely) TypeScript

**Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?**
- I hope I'm able to come out with a satisfactory product!
